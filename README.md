# Advent Of Code: 2024

-   This year has been one of the greatest years of my life, and nothing's better to celebrate it other than completing the annual challenge: Advent Of Code!

-   I will try my best to complete this challenge every single day for the rest of December 2024. (commits might be inconsistent, but hopefully I can complete it in time).

# Small notes:

-   Newlines are treated as `\n`, because I'm coding in an Unix environment.
