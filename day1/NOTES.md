# Flow

-   Parse the two lists
-   Sort them into incremental order
-   Get the absolute value of the difference between two elements with the same index
-   Since both the list are equal in length, it's safe to do this

## Parsing the list

-   Create two arrays
-   For each input line, we split the line into two parts, the former belongs to the first array, and the latter belongs to the second array.

## Sorting the array

-   Self-explanatory

## Finding the sum

-   Now that both arrays are sorted in incremental order, we can finally get the difference between each element of both arrays, (difference = the value must be a positive number), and then adding them all up.
